**India is on the greatest toilet-building spree in human history**
After becoming the prime minister in 2014, Narender Modi signaled that sanitation would be a top most priority in his social
programe. Following his manifesto, in this same year in the month of October he introduced the Swacch Bharat Abhiyan or the 
Clean India Campaign.
It was basically a raft of public appeals and policies aimed towards creating a "Clean India" by the end of his government's term. 
Corporate support was commandeered to reduce open defecation, and for this he alloted $20 billion with an aim of contructing 111
million latrines or toilets in five years.
In April Mr. Modi urged a gathering of state ministers to help create “wealth out of waste.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s $20 billion “Swachh Bharat Abhiyan” aims to construct 111 million latrines in five years.

Besides promising to improve the health, safety and dignity of hundreds of millions of Indians,
the national hygiene drive has spurred an 81 percent jump in sales of concrete building materials
and 48 percent increase in bathroom and sanitaryware sales, according to Euromonitor International.
